# Open Source Contributions

I contribute to open source to get hands-on experience in real codebases: reading unfamiliar architecture, writing tests, fixing bugs, and shipping changes through review.


## Featured

- **IBM/mcp-context-forge** — Fixed duplicate loading spinner on the A2A Agents admin page by removing a redundant inline placeholder, aligning with the pattern already used across other tabs. (Merged PR [#2892](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/pull/2892))
