# Open Source Contributions

I contribute to open source to get hands-on experience in real codebases: reading unfamiliar architecture, writing tests, fixing bugs, and shipping changes through review.


## Featured

- **IBM/mcp-context-forge** — Fixed duplicate loading spinner on the A2A Agents admin page by removing a redundant inline placeholder, aligning with the pattern already used across other tabs. (Merged PR [#2892](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/pull/2892))
- **DjangoCRM/django-crm** — Added unit tests for the `reload_field` view, covering authentication, field filtering, preview output, and response validation. (Merged PR [#388](https://github.com/DjangoCRM/django-crm/pull/388))
- **korcankaraokcu/PINCE** — Fixed arrow-key scrolling in the hex dump memory viewer by adding a `scroll_requested` signal and ensured selection stays in sync when navigating past row boundaries. (Merged PR [#312](https://github.com/korcankaraokcu/PINCE/pull/312))
- **marketcalls/openalgo** — Improved admin UX by adding dynamic `aria-label` attributes to inline-edit inputs across multiple pages and implemented clear Search API error handling with toast notifications and inline messages. (Merged PR [#899](https://github.com/marketcalls/openalgo/pull/899) · [#900](https://github.com/marketcalls/openalgo/pull/900))
