# Open Source Contributions

I contribute to open source to get hands-on experience in real codebases: reading unfamiliar architecture, writing tests, fixing bugs, and shipping changes through review.

## Where I contribute

I focus on repos that let me practice real engineering work: debugging in unfamiliar codebases, writing tests, improving reliability and UX, and shipping changes through review.

- **IBM/mcp-context-forge** — MCP gateway / agent tooling (Python).
- **DjangoCRM/django-crm** — Django CRM app (Python/Django).
- **PINCE** — Linux reverse-engineering GUI (Python/Qt). 
- **openalgo** — Trading platform admin UI (web).
