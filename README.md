## What this demonstrates
- **Codebase ramp-up:** I can read existing architecture and make safe changes.
- **Quality habits:** I add tests / regression coverage where it makes sense.
- **Review-ready work:** small scoped PRs, clear descriptions, iteration based on feedback.
- **User impact:** accessibility, UX, bugfixes that reduce friction.
